# Docs for vk-to-telegram-bot

## About security
* It's highly recommended to hide your bot from web. (e.g you site.com directory is /var/www/site.com, so don't place bot in that directory place it in /var/www/console/)

## I have set my channel url, but I have an error with it
* Make sure that you set channel name without @

## I want to set parsing from VK user profile, not from group
* Stay tuned, I will add this feature soon
